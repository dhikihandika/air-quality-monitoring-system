# air-quality-monitoring-system
it is project get on Internship PT. Parametrik Research and Development

Require Hardware:
1. ESP8266
2. Arduino Promini
3. MQ-135 GAS Sensor
4. Modul comunication RS-485
5. Other device to signal proccessig and voltage regulator

Require Software:
1. Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Evironment)

Attention !!
- Before make wiring and code program pay attention you must understand spesification each device 
- On project you must create two program on Arduino IDE. its use to;
1. Collect data sensor MQ135 form Arduino Promini
2. Post data to cloud from ESP8266
- Communication Arduino promini and ESP8266 used RS-485 module (you can use SoftwareSerial())
